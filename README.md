# rosehip productions app

rosehip productions needed an app to promote their events management and consultation company. This website offers information about their owner, breaks down a listing of their services, shows examples of the clients they have worked with and a contact page to allow future clients to contact the company.

## Design Choices
* [Hero Image](https://marc-marquez.github.io/rosehip-angular/#/home) - Client preferred the "just hands" [photo](https://github.com/marc-marquez/rosehip-angular/blob/master/img/KJWedFL-201-1920-sm.jpg) when in mobile view (< 576px).
